# TASK SPAM DETECTION using TENSORFLOW and Artificial Intelligence -Machine Learning
# Learner: DANIELE CASTROVINCI

 
The provided code involves  a classic machine learning algorithm known as Naive Bayes, to perform a taskâ€”spam detection.
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence and it involves creating algorithms and models that enable computers
to learn and make predictions  based on data without explicit programming. 
This code contains:
1) Data Preprocessing:
The text data is transformed into a numerical representation using CountVectorizer where words are converted into numerical vectors.
2) Model Training:
The MultinomialNB classifier, a type of Naive Bayes model, is instantiated and trained on the transformed text data to learn patterns
that distinguish between 'spam' and 'ham' messages.
3) Prediction: A new message is processed in the same way as the training data and then classified as 'spam' or 'ham' using the trained model.
